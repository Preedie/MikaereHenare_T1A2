# My First Webpage Project

My main objective throughout the project is to implement the learnt techniques during the inital phase of my journey to learning how to build a web page.

This particular portfolio project readme will display a site map and wireframe for the personal webpage i built. 

# SITE MAP PICTURE

# WIREFRAME PICTURE

The following picture illustrates the wireframe build of my web page.
The theme of the web page was "pixelated" even the font and background I chose reflects this. I personally enjoy pixelated images and how basic/minimalistic they can be, so I built the website around that.
the color scheme was chosen as it fit nicely with the overall color scheme of the background image aswell as the fact that I quite like Japanese cherry blossoms which this particular color theme reminds me of.

The pages are completely responsive to mobile and desktop enviroments which will be noticable when or if the user decides to shrink or increase the size of the browser window (in any direction).
