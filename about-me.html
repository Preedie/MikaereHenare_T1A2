    <p>
    Hello, there.
    My name, as given to me at my ascension through the crust of earth is, 
    Mikaere Henare, which is Maori or "Kiwi" for Michael Henry which trust me I'm fully aware is 
    the most simple white male name with the most found english second 
    name to follow it, so dont let the exotic sounding nature of my name fool you there. 
    But to get down to business "to defeat the huns", If I were to explain who I'am I would say
    I'm a laid back and relaxed guy that likes to make people laugh, 
    likes to do anything and everything physical and I will always look through the bad 
    to see the good in said bad situations and even sometimes to my own demise, in people. 
    </p>
